# Scripts

Various set of utils to improve Okcupid pages.


## ZbynekOkcupidQuestionPriority

This allows giving questions priorities and showing them accordingly sorted.  User can then select questions which he is most interested in and see them always on the top, no matter whether they are interesting for the other party.
